#
# This file contains key values pairs which are used to expand variable references in
# the JSON-based regex pattern definition files. This is useful both to share common
# regex patterns across multiple rules but also to avoid the complexities of escaping
# JSON string literals. The strings below are directly testable in web sites such as 
# reg101.com.
#
# Shared strings can be assembled even within this file as long as any shared pattern
# in a strings only contains variables which are defined earlier in the file. So, 
# a pattern like this is ok (but these lines in reverse order are not).
#
# $MyExample=[a-z]
# $MyExpandedExample=($MyExample|[0-9])
#
# Blank lines are ignored when parsing, as are lines that begin with a '#' character.
# Leading spaces are trimmed at parse time, allowing for indentation.

# Common patterns for file allow and deny lists.
